## Group 1 Project Proposal

#### Cameron Carlyle, Aditya Duggirala, Iverson Lai

### Abstract
We plan to create an investment application that 
will look at our personal holdings (stocks etfs commodities bonds etc) 
and ones of particular interest and provide alerts when there
are dramatic shifts in prices. The alerts will be delivered when there is
a shift of x% or more in a given period of y hours with x and y defined by the
user.

### Bodies of Work
* Back End
  * API for pulling prices (stocks etfs) (marketstack.com API)
  * Database for storing personal holdings and user contact (SQL database)
* Front End Development
  * Login page
  * Portfolio Page
  * Page to add stocks
  * Page of trending (S&P 500 stocks that have seen dramatic shifts)

### Work Split
Aditya will lead the back end work with IV support
Cameron will lead the front end development
Iverson will lead the database work
